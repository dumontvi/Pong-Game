# Pong-Game
A gesture based multiplayer pong game using a variety of inputs such as hand gestures, push buttons or light sensors. 

This project recreates the Pong Game and provides the user with number of options to play. It is developed in Assembly and is run on the DE-1 Soc FPGA board. It makes uses of NIOS-2 and hardwares such as flex sensors and LEGO electrical toolbox (light sensors). The score appears on the HEX display on the FPGA. It also makes use of the Analog to Digital converter(ADC) on the FPGA to convert the analog value of the flex sensor to discrete values, helping the user to move the pong bar.
